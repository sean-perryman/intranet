# Intranet Site

Hoping to combine IT Ticket Tracking, Employee Directory, and some other document storage things into one site.

TODO:
RYO User Authentication or Devise
Assignable user roles (i.e. user, administrator, technician)
Email notifications for users as well as technicians
User ability to edit own tickets (probably description only)
